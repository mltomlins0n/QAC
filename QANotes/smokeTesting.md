# Smoke Testing 

- Also known as “Build Verification Testing”. 

- Tests the most important functions. 

- Used to decide if a build is stable enough to undergo further testing, usually functional testing. 

- Name allegedly comes from hardware testing, where a device passed a test if it didn’t catch fire when turned on. 

- If a smoke test fails, stop all testing until a new build with the required fixes is available. 

- Can be performed manually or automated and should be automated if builds are frequent. 

- Tests can be automated using Selenium and PhantomJS. 

- Normally used in Integration, System, and Acceptance testing levels. 

## Advantages 

- Exposes integration issues. 

- Exposes problems early. 

- Can save time and money later by catching issues early. 

## Disadvantages

- Non-exhaustive testing means that many issues can be overlooked.

- Small number of test cases
